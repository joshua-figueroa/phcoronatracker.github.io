# PHCoronaTracker

This website was created by Joshua Figueroa, a Grade 10 student from Manila Science High School.
                                The purpose of this website is to help people to get the latest and simplified information about the COVID-19 Pandemic not only in our country but also throughout
                                the world. This also aims to prevent the spread of fake news and panic. It includes a dashboard that tallies the total cases of the disease, maps about their 
                                residency and a graph that tells its trend. The new version of this website also includes a Vaccine and Treatment Tracker that are still under clinical trials. 
                                This site is constantly updated and is sourced from the Department of Health, Johns Hopkins University and other International Media Outlets.
