This website was created by Joshua Figueroa, a Grade 10 student from Manila Science High School.
                                The purpose of this website is to help people to get the latest and simplified information about the COVID-19 Pandemic not only in our country but also throughout
                                the world. This also aims to prevent the spread of fake news and panic. It includes a dashboard that tallies the total cases of the disease, maps about patients'
                                residency, graphs that tells the disease trend and many more. All local data are manually collected from DOH COVID-19 Data Drop every night.
                                If you've found the site to be useful, please support me by giving me a cup of coffee at the sponsor button above.
                                This will help me provide more usable content and new features. Every donation received will be spent for the site's maintenance and server hosting costs.
